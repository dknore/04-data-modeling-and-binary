# Lab 04:  Bitmap Transformer

### Author: Darcy Knore

### Description:<br>
This project is a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI.

It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color or raster transforms and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. 

### Architecture:
This project uses javascript, jQuery, fs, and node.  With the user experience in mind, the application layout was thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and able to be executed efficiently.

### Change Log
This application has not been launched.
